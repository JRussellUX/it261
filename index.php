        <h2>About Jennifer</h2>
        <img class="right" src="images/jennifer.jpeg" alt="Jennifer">
        <p>I am a mother to a daughter who just entered middle school.
            I also have two bunnies that are a handful, and a dog who is
            the best dog ever! I worked in healthcare for eleven years
            and realized during the pandemic I needed to switch careers for my daughters health.
            After deciding web design was the path I wanted to take, I joined an
            online bootcamp and enjoyed every second. I've worked as a freelancer ever since.
            Now I am excited to work towards my degree in a feild I enjoy so much!
            Outside of school and work, I enjoy playing video games, hiking, and baking with my daughter.
        </p>
